Runs unattended install including custom list of packages\r\n1. Inserts custom configuration (shared team config, your file replication location, etc.)\r\n**What you do:** Run Install-Cygwin.bat, then open Cygwin prompt to start working!\r\n**What your team does:** Runs the admin/tooling lead's customized version of Install-Cygwin.bat, then starts working with team-preconfigured Cygwin.\r\n\r\n# Support and feedback\r\n* inline comments document key parts of script\r\n* [Issues List](https://github.com/zephans/cygwin-installer/issues)\r\nCurated and extended with love and desperation by @zephans. \r\n\r\n# Thanks to \r\n* @miguelgrinberg for the [parent cygwin-installer project](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/cygwin-installer) (especially the inline .vbs create&execute). \r\n* @stephenmm for [auto-install-cygwin](https://github.com/stephenmm/auto-install-cygwin) which has similar concepts plus some cool ideas for core file replication (via junctions to existing dropbox folders).\r\n* @mojmir-svoboda for [GetFile.vbs concept](https://gist.github.com/mojmir-svoboda/02bb4b683ec14d9bb9c1)\r\n* @wjrogers for [install.bat](https://gist.github.com/wjrogers/1016065)... one of the ancestors of this project\r\n* everyone else who has donated time, tips, and ideas to make Cygwin easier to quickly install and get ready for real work.\r\n\r\nCurated and extended with love (and desperate need) by @zephans. Change frequence indicates how close to \"done\" this project is. Code churn by definition means project is less stable or has issue(s) being worked on :-).\r\n",
