# Command Line Cygwin Installer

This repository contains a small batch file that automates a basic Cygwin install. The script also installs the third-party apt-cyg package manager.

See Miguel Grinberg's blog article [Web Development on Windows Does Not Need To Suck](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/web-development-on-windows-does-not-need-to-suck) for an overview of Cygwin and this installer.
